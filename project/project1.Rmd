### 0. Introduction

#### As a Biology major, I decided to use the Wisconsin Brest Cancer Dataset obtained from: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data. Since I could not find a dataset to join with this one, I will separate it into 2 datasets.


#### This dataset contains 32 measurements of breast cancer samples from 569 patients. `id` represents the unique IDs of all the samples. `diagnosis` classifies the tumors as either benign (`B`) or malignant (`M`). This dataset also contains measurements of the mean (`mean`), standard error (`se`), and maximum (`worst`) for each feature, including:

####  1. `radius` (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
####  2. `texture` (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
####  3. `perimeter`
####  4. `area`
####  5. `smoothness` (local variation in radius lengths)
####  6. `compactness` (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
####  7. `concavity` (severity of concave portions of the contour)
####  8. `concave_points` (number of concave portions of the contour)
####  9. `symmetry`
#### 10. `fractal_dimension` ("coastline approximation" - 1).

#### For this project, I will only be focusing on `diagnosis` and the mean measurements of these features.



### 1. Joining/Merging

#### Load packages

```{R}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(factoextra)
```

#### Read in the dataset

```{R}
# Read in the dataset
breast_cancer = read_csv("/stor/home/yw9497/Website/content/project/WisconsinBreastCancerDatabase.csv")

# Take a glimpse
glimpse(breast_cancer)
```

#### Split this dataset into 2 datasets

```{R}
# Make sure `id` is contained in both datasets
breast_cancer_1 = breast_cancer[, 1 : 16]
breast_cancer_2 = breast_cancer[, c(1, 17 : 32)]

# Take a glimpse on both datasets
glimpse(breast_cancer_1)
glimpse(breast_cancer_2)
```

#### Join the 2 datasets back together

```{R}
# Perform a left join on `breast_cancer_1`, by `id`
breast_cancer_joined = 
  breast_cancer_1 %>% left_join(breast_cancer_2, by = "id")

# Take a glimpse
glimpse(breast_cancer_joined)
```

*Since these 2 datasets both contain the exact same values in the `id` column, no observations will be dropped no matter which type of join (among left/right/inner/full) is used. Here, I chose left join to obtain the same dataset before the splitting.*


### 2. Wrangling

#### Select the columns in interest

```{R}
# Since I decided to not focusing on `se` or `worst`,
# remove those columns
breast_cancer_joined = breast_cancer_joined %>% select(1 : 12)

# Take a glimpse
glimpse(breast_cancer_joined)
```

#### Calculate summary statistics for all numeric variables

```{R}
# Calculate the mean for each numeric variables
breast_cancer_stats_all = breast_cancer_joined %>% 
  select(-c(id, diagnosis)) %>% # Drop the first 2 columns (`id` and `diagnosis`)
  summarize_all(c(mean = mean, # Mean
                  sd = sd, # Standard deviation
                  percentile = quantile, # Percentile
                  min = min, # Minimum
                  max = max)) # Maximum

# Take a glimpse
glimpse(breast_cancer_stats_all)
```

#### Calculate summary statistics for all numeric variables, grouping by a categorical variable

```{R}
# Calculate the summary statistics for each numeric variables
breast_cancer_stats_group = breast_cancer_joined %>% 
  select(-id) %>% # Drop the first column (`id`)
  group_by(diagnosis) %>% # Group by `diagnosis`
  summarize_all(c(mean = mean, # Mean
                  sd = sd, # Standard deviation
                  percentile = quantile, # Percentile
                  min = min, # Minimum
                  max = max)) %>% # Maximum
  pivot_longer(-diagnosis) %>% # Pivot longer
  separate(name, into = c("feature", "stat"), 
           sep = "_(?=[^_]+$)") %>% # Separate the `name` column
  mutate(rn = row_number()) %>% # Add a column of unique identifiers to avoid problems
  pivot_wider(names_from = diagnosis, values_from = value) %>% # Pivot wider
  select(-rn) # Remove the column of row numbers

# Take a glimpse
glimpse(breast_cancer_stats_group)
```

#### Arrange by `radius_mean` in ascending order

```{R}
breast_cancer_joined_arranged = 
  breast_cancer_joined %>% arrange(radius_mean)

# Take a glimpse
glimpse(breast_cancer_joined_arranged)
```

#### Calculate the ratio of `concavity_mean` to `concave_points_mean`

```{R}
breast_cancer_joined_concave_ratio = 
  breast_cancer_joined %>% 
  mutate(concave_mean_ratio = 
           concavity_mean / concave_points_mean)

# Take a glimpse
glimpse(breast_cancer_joined_concave_ratio)
```

#### Get the info for sample with maximum `radius_mean` for each categorical variable

```{R}
breast_cancer_joined %>%
  group_by(diagnosis) %>% # Group by `diagnosis`
  filter(radius_mean == max(radius_mean)) # Filter for max value in `radius_mean`
```


### 3. Visualizing

#### Create a heatmap

```{R}
# Create a correlation matrix
cormat = breast_cancer_joined %>%
  select_if(is.numeric) %>% # Select numeric variables
  select(-id) %>% # Remove the `id` column
  cor(use = "pair") # Calculate correlations

# Tidy the correlation matrix
tidycor = cormat %>%
  as.data.frame %>% # Change a matrix to a dataframe
  rownames_to_column("var1") %>% # Copy rownames to a column `var1`
  pivot_longer(-1, names_to = "var2", values_to = "correlation") # Pivot longer

# Create a heatmap
tidycor %>%
  ggplot(aes(var1, var2, fill = correlation))+
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_gradient2("Correlation", low = "blue", mid = "white",
                       high = "red") + # Set legend title and colors
  geom_text(aes(label = round(correlation, 2)),color = "black", 
            size = 2) + # Set text size and color
  ggtitle("Correlations between Numeric Variables") + # Add a title
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) + # Rotate the x labels
  xlab("") + # Remove x-axis label
  ylab("") + # Remove y-axis label
  coord_fixed() # Set it as a square
```

*This heatmap shows the correlation between 2 numeric variables, with red representing a positive correlation, and blue representing a negative one. As shown by the plot, there is an extremely strong, positive, and linear relationship between any pairwise comparisons among `radius_mean`, `perimeter_mean`, and `area_mean`.*

#### Create a scatterplot

```{R}
# Create a scatterplot between `radius_mean` and `perimeter_mean`
ggplot(breast_cancer_joined, aes(x = radius_mean, y = perimeter_mean)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = factor(diagnosis, # Color the dots by diagnosis
                                labels = c("Benign", "Malignant"))), # Add labels to the factor
             size = 2.5) +  # Make the dots larger
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Accent") + # Change the default color
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "black", se = F) + # Add a trend line
  labs(title = "Perimeter Mean vs. Radius Mean", # Add a title
       color = "Diagnosis") + # Rename the legend title
  scale_x_continuous("Radius Mean", # Rename x-axis label
                     breaks = seq(6, 28, by = 2)) + # Add more tick marks
  scale_y_continuous("Perimeter Mean", # Rename y-axis label
                     breaks = seq(40, 180, by = 20)) + # Add more tick marks
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") # Move legend to the bottom
```

*This scatterplot confirms the strong, positive, and linear relationship between  `radius_mean` and `perimeter_mean`. This plot also shows that malignant tumors tend to have greater `radius_mean` and `perimeter_mean` when compared to benign tumors.*

#### Create a barplot

```{R}
# Create a barplot of `concavity_mean`
ggplot(breast_cancer_joined, aes(x = factor(diagnosis, levels = c("M", "B"), 
                                            labels = c("Malignant",
                                                       "Benign")), 
                                 y = concavity_mean, 
                                 fill = factor(diagnosis,  # Color the dots by diagnosis
                                               labels = c("Benign", 
                                                         "Malignant")))) + # Add labels to the factor
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Accent") + # Change the default color
  geom_bar(stat = "summary") + # Plot the mean
  geom_errorbar(stat = "summary", width = 0.5) + # Add errorbars
  ggtitle("Mean of Concavity Mean by Diagnosis") + # Add a title
  xlab("Diagnosis") + # Rename x-axis label
  ylab("Mean of Concavity Mean") + # Rename y-axis label
  theme(legend.position = "none") # Remove the legend
```

*This braplot shows the mean of the `concavity_mean` measurements by `diagnosis`. According to the plot, the mean of `concavity_mean` is greater for malignant tumors than for benign tumors.*

### 4. Dimensionality Reduction

#### Perform PCA

```{r}
# Drop the `id` column
breast_cancer_num = breast_cancer_joined %>% select(-id) %>%
  select_if(is.numeric) %>% # Select all numeric variables
  scale # Scale the values

# Set the rownames of `breast_cancer_num` as `id`
rownames(breast_cancer_num) = breast_cancer_joined$id

# Perform PCA
breast_cancer_pca = princomp(breast_cancer_num)

# Summarize the results
summary(breast_cancer_pca, loadings = T)
```

*The top part of the results summarizes the standard deviation, proportion of variance, and cumulative proportion for each PC.*

*The bottom part summarizes the loadings. PC1 is a general axis. Higher scores on PC1 correspond with greater measurements for all features. Higher scores on PC2 correspond with greater measurements in `radius_mean`, `texture_mean`, `perimeter_mean`, and `area_mean`, but relatively smaller measurements for other features.*

#### Create a scree plot

```{r}
# Calculate the eigenvalues by squaring the standard deviations
eigval = (breast_cancer_pca$sdev) ^ 2

# Proportion of variance explained by each PC
varprop = round(eigval / sum(eigval), 2)

# Create a scree plot
ggplot() + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = 1 : 10, y = varprop, fill = 1 : 10), stat = "identity") +  # Plot the proportion of variance explained by each PC
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "Spectral") + # Change the default color
  geom_path(aes(x = 1 : 10, y = varprop)) +  # Add an elbow plot
  geom_text(aes(x = 1 : 10, y = varprop, label = varprop), vjust = -0.25, 
            size = 4) + # Add labels
  ggtitle("% Variance Explained by Each PC") + # Add a title
  scale_x_continuous("PC", # Rename the x-axis title
                     breaks = 1 : 10) + # Adjust the breaks
  scale_y_continuous("% Variance Explained", # Rename the y-axis title
                     breaks = seq(0, .6, .2), # Adjust the breaks
                     labels = scales::percent) + # Change y-axis labels to %
  theme(legend.position = "none") # Remove the legend
```

*According to the elbow plot, I will keep the first 3 PCs, which will summarize `89%` of the total variability.*

#### Create a loadings plot

```{r}
# Create a dataframe of the first 2 PCs
breast_cancer_pca$loadings[1:10, 1:2] %>% as.data.frame %>% 
  rownames_to_column %>% 
  ggplot() + geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 0), lty = 2) +  # Plot the loadings
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = 0), lty = 2) + 
  xlab("PC1") + ylab("PC2") + # Rename the axis titles
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0, y = 0, xend = Comp.1, yend = Comp.2), arrow = arrow(),
               col = "steelblue") + # Add arrows
  geom_label(aes(x = Comp.1 * 1.2, y = Comp.2 * 1.2, label = rowname)) # Add labels
```

*In a loadings plot, the angle between 2 vectors represents the correlation between the 2 variables. In this loadings plot, the labels for `radius_mean`, `perimeter_mean`, and `area_mean`are overlapping each other. This is expected because these 3 variables are strongly correlated with each other.*

#### Create a biplot

```{r}
fviz_pca_biplot(breast_cancer_pca, col.ind = "gray")
```

*This biplot combines the previous loadings plot with PC scores of all samples.*

#### Create a scatterplot

```{r}
results = breast_cancer_joined %>%
  # Add the first 4 PCs
  mutate(PC1 = breast_cancer_pca$scores[, 1],
         PC2 = breast_cancer_pca$scores[, 2], 
         PC3 = breast_cancer_pca$scores[, 3], 
         PC4 = breast_cancer_pca$scores[, 4])

# Create a scatterplot of PC1 vs. PC2
results %>% ggplot(aes(x = PC1, y = PC2)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = factor(diagnosis, # Color the dots by `diagnosis`
                                labels = c("Benign", "Malignant"))), # Add labels to the legend
             size = 3) + # Make the dots larger
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Accent") + # Change the colors
  labs(title = "PC1 vs. PC2", # Add a title
       color = "Diagnosis") # Rename the legend title

# Create a scatterplot of PC3 vs. PC4
results %>% ggplot(aes(x = PC3, y = PC4)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = factor(diagnosis, # Color the dots by `diagnosis`
                                labels = c("Benign", "Malignant"))), # Add labels to the legend
             size = 3) + # Make the dots larger
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Accent") + # Change the colors
  labs(title = "PC3 vs. PC4", # Add a title
       color = "Diagnosis") # Rename the legend title
```

*These 2 scatterplots plot the PC scores of the samples. In the scatterplots, we can see that PC1 separates the malignant and benign tumors. However, PCs 2-4 all fail to separate the 2 types of tumors.*
