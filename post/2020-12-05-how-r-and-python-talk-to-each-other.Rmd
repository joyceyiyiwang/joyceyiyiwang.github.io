# How R and Python Talk to Each Other

Believe it or not, R and Python can talk to each other! This can be accomplished with the R package `reticulate`.

For example:

```{r}
# Using R
library(reticulate) # Load the `reticulate` package
str1 = "This is how R"
```

```{python}
# Using Python
str2 = "and python talk to each other."
print(r.str1, str2)
```
